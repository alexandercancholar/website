                    <p class="project-description">The Google Cloud Server was deployed to operate continuously with automated rebooting capabilities. This server was implemented for a Minecraft environment, accommodating up to 14 concurrent players at peak usage. Hosted on a Google Cloud Platform virtual machine running Ubuntu Linux, the server utilized command line operations for management and enabled external mod packs to enhance player experience. The Minecraft server remains accessible today on a designated IP address and specific game version.</p>

                    <p class="project-description">Since its inception in 2021, this sandrail project has evolved from a basic frame into a fully operational vehicle powered by a K20 engine swapped from a 2005 Acura RSX Base Model. Custom wiring harness adapters were developed, and a KTuner ECU was installed to optimize fuel-to-air ratios. The dashboard was meticulously hand-wired and soldered, with additional welding performed on the frame to secure mounting points. The project also included the integration of fuse boxes with appropriately rated fuses and relays, alongside the precise use of a voltmeter for system calibration.</p>

                    <p class="project-description">This C++-based Wordle game was developed with a focus on terminal compatibility, enabling synchronized interaction between the game interface and the keyboard. The game is fully projected within the terminal, featuring real-time statistics, multiple game modes, and a data persistence feature that saves progress upon exit and resumes seamlessly on re-entry. The design incorporates two parallel terminal processes: one displaying the game and another tracking keyboard output. This project demonstrates effective use of terminal-based synchronization and data management, enhancing player experience through intuitive controls and persistent gameplay.</p>

                    <p class="project-description">This C-based Tic-Tac-Toe game was designed for terminal play, allowing users to compete against either another player or a computer-controlled AI. The AI component includes three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and an "impossible" mode powered by an advanced algorithm, providing a challenging experience for players. The game features customizable matrix sizes for flexible gameplay, real-time statistics tracking, and seamless interaction within the terminal environment. This project showcases the implementation of adaptive AI strategies, player-versus-player and player-versus-computer modes, and an engaging, customizable user experience within a command-line interface.</p>
